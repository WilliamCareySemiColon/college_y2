on in Week4 

SECTION TWO contains templates for SQL statements to retrieve data using comparison operators and logical conditions
You should replace these as we go through with the correct SQL to work for our game shop


SECTION THREE contains templates fo SQL statements to retrieve data from multple tables using INNER JOINS
