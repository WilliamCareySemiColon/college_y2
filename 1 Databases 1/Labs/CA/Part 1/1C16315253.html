			<h1>My Erwin Key Decisions</h1>
			<p>
				The key decisions for any of the entities. This includes what 
				is defined as a unique feature (Primary Key) to what feature from one entity 
				is needed in another entity (Foriegn Key). As well as these features, we
				also need error-check input to make sure the programme runs smooth. So 
				we constain them.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to effectly work at this part of the CA, I went through the
				assignment worksheet which had all the details of what should be in the 
				data model. Once I broke it down, I was able to piece the model itself. 
				To make sure I was going on track, I double check with my notes to make 
				the model is done correctly. I plan to check it multiple times to ensure 
				I feel it is done correctly.

			<h3>Decisions for Stock_Item</h3>
			<p>
				The first entity to be dealt with is the Stock Item. What this means is
				what items are in store to purchase. When running a programme to keep
				track of the stock items, what is needed to distinush any item from 
				another is six attributes. The most important is the five digit unique 
				identity code. This would allow the user of the programme to know 
				instantly what the item is. There will be other details including 
				the item type, how much it was purchased from the supplier
				(import_price), how much it will be sold for (export_price), how many 
				in store (quatity) and the description behind the item. This would be,
				example a game console, what the speed of the console is and how to 
				operate it on some level. It would also have the processor speed and 
				what type of machines are needed to effectly run the console.
			</p>
			<h5>Relationships with other entities</h5>
			<p>
				It has a many to many relationship with supplier entity and one to many 
				relationship with game entity. The reason behind these entities is one 
				factor behind the two. That is how many can each have between the 
				relationship. With supplier entity, stock can have many suppliers and the 
				supplier can have many supplies of stock. With the game entity, stock can 
				have many games but game can only be of one stock (type). The game would 
				share the same ID code as one of the stock item due to the fact it is 
				essentially part of the stock items itself.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Decisions for Games</h3>
			<p>
			There are two main features of games wich makes the unique. Their offical title
			and their stock Id code. These two features can be combine to make an even more
			unique item. However, this is not nesscary. The other features on the game itself
			is the consoles needed (could be more than one), the release date, age group and 
			tthe required skills to play the game itself. We need to make sure the naming 
			convection of the game itself is apporiate to the target audience. Once that is 
			completed, the item itself will have a description (under the relationship with 
			stock item). Included in this desciption is the skills required to play the game.
			</p>
			<h5>Relationships with other entities</h5>
			<p>
				It has a many to many relationship with Reviewer entity and many to one
				relationship with stock_item entity. Reviewers can review mutliple games and
				one game can have many reviewers. One stock can have many games but one game 
				cannot be many stock. 
			</p>
			
			<h3>Decisions for Supplier</h3>
			<p>
				The supplier itself is a company, therefore its name would be unique. Their
				main email and the id code assigned to them are both unique, as to effectly 
				allow them to stand out. This would make three unique features, allowing the  
				build of a onumious unique code. Their phone number, sales representive and 
				stock supplied could be competed by other companies, making the other features
				not unique. Therfore the company name, their main email and company code are 
				their primary keys. Their code must be of five digits and their email must 
				have an '@' in it.
			</p>
			
			<h5>Relationships with other entities</h5>
			<p>
				It has a many to many relantion with stock item and sale representives, as 
				stock can be supplied by many suppliers and suppliers can supply many stock 
				items. With sale representives, there can be many sale representive working 
				for a supplier and and sale representive can work for more than one supplier.
				With supply order, it is one to many relantion as the supplier can supply more
				than one order but supply orders can be from one company only.  
			</p>
			
			<h3>Decisions for Sale Representive</h3>
			<p>
				The sale representive is someone who a person works with for business reasons. 
				The name, phone number and email of that sale representive may not be unique. 
				However, each one has a five digit unique code, which can be used to track 
				their services. Because of this, that would be the primary key.
			</p>
			
			<h5>Relationships with other entities</h5>
			<p>
				It has a one to many relantion with supply order and a many to many relantion 
				with suppliers, as an order can come through one sale representive at a time 
				but one sale representive can do many supply order. One supplier company can many 
				sale representive and one sale representive can work for mutliple suppliers.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Decisions on supply order</h3>
			<p>
				Supply order are very unique, as not only do they have their own six unique code,
				but adopt the sale representive unique code, the companies unique code, the 
				company name and their main email as part of their unique features (due to their 
				many to one relantions). As a result of these, they are unique in many of their 
				own ways. It takes other primary keys as unique foreign keys as well as adopting 
				it own unique primary key.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Decisions on reviewers</h3>
			<p>
				Reviewers are only linked to the game sector, as that is all they can review. There 
				is a many to many relation with games, as one reviewer can review more than one 
				game, as well as one game can have many reviewers. The reviewers have a unique username 
				and a list of the  games they already have reviewed. This is due to the fact they cannot 
				review the same twice. Because of this, the username and the review list of games 
				are the primary keys.
